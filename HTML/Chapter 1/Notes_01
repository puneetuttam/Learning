Chapter 1 Creating our first website

We start building a website by creating a file named index.html. It is a special filename which is presented when the website root address is typed

A Basic HTML page

<!Doctype html>                             -> specifies this is an html5 doc
<html>                                      ->root of html page
    <head>                                  -> contains page metadata
        <title> </title>                    -> condtains title
    </head>                                 -> Cosing tag of head
    <body>                                  ->The main body of the page(rendered by the browser)
    <H1>This is heading</H1>                -> heading tags
    <p> my paragrabh</p>                    -> paragraph tag
    </body>                                 ->closing body tag 
</html> 


A tags is like a container for either content or other HTML tags

HTML Docs   -> Browser  -> Redndered page

IMPORTANT NOTES
    Head and body are children of HTML tags
    HTML is the parent of head and body tags
    Most of the HTML elements have opening and closing tags with content in it.
    Some HTML tags have no content. These are called Empty elements eg<br>
    We can either user htm or html extension for our html files
    You can use "Inspect Element" or view Page Source" option from chrome to look into a website's HTML code.

    HTML element=>start tags + Content + End tags
