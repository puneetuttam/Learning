HTML: Hyper text Markup Language

HTML is the language of the web. It is used to create websites
We use HTMLtags to define look and feel of a websites

With understanding of these tags and How to put them together, we can create beautiful websites easily

Then why CSS and JavaScript
HTML is used for defining layout of a page- A barebone page structure

CSS is used to add styling to that barebobepage created using HTML

JavaScriptis used to program logic for the page layout example what happens when a user hover a text, when to hide or show elements etc.

A BEAUTIFUL ANALOGY
HTML= Car body
CSS = Car paint, decoration
JavaScript= Car engine + Interior Logics
